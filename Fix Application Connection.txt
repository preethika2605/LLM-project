Fix Application Connection

Fix the application startup and connection issues by addressing configuration conflicts and package mismatches

Backend (Fix Structure & Logic)
The backend has structural issues (wrong packages) and configuration conflicts.

[MODIFY] 

OllamaService.java
Issue: Package declaration com.localai.backend.service does not match folder structure com.localai.service.
Fix: Change package to package com.localai.service;.
[DELETE] 
CorsConfig.java
Issue:
Redundant CORS configuration conflicting with 
BackendApplication.java
.
Wrong package declaration (com.localai.backend.config).
Incorrectly restricts origin to localhost:3000 (Frontend is on 5173).
Fix: Delete this file.

Connection (Finalize & Run)
Ensure the connection between Frontend and Backend is established via correct CORS settings in the main application class.

[MODIFY] 
BackendApplication.java
Action: Ensure allowedOrigins includes http://localhost:5173.
Status: Currently has http://localhost:5173 and http://localhost:3000. This is correct and will work once 
CorsConfig.java
 is removed.
Verification Plan
Automated Tests
Backend Startup: Run mvn spring-boot:run and ensure it starts without error.
Frontend Startup: Run npm run dev and ensure it starts on port 5173.
Manual Verification
Open App: Navigate to http://localhost:5173.
Test Chat: Send a message "Hello".
Verify Response:
Success: Bot responds (requires Ollama running).
Connection Success: Even if Ollama is off, network tab should show 200 OK or 500 Error (from backend), NOT CORS Error.
